# Comprehensive Technical Documentation Generation

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - FORENSIC ACCURACY MANDATE

### Zero-Assumption Policy

- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: No functionality may be documented without direct code verification
- **MANDATORY VALIDATION**: Every behavior must trace to specific source implementation
- **CROSS-VERIFICATION**: Confirm understanding through multiple code paths and edge cases
- **SOURCE CITATION**: Include file paths and line references for all critical implementations

## Documentation Mission & Scope

1. Create comprehensive technical documentation for godot-cpp's internal mechanisms, focusing exclusively on:
   - Internal implementation details rarely documented elsewhere
   - Complex type system and marshalling mechanisms
   - ClassDB internals and template metaprogramming
   - Memory management boundaries and ownership rules
   - Binary communication between GDExtension libraries and Godot Engine
   - All error conditions (internal and user-facing)

2. Maintain a very detailed progress tracker to track progress as well as being able to refer to when determining if the task is complete

- Error condition exhaustiveness
- Platform variation completeness

### Deliverable Requirements

Begin with:
1. Detailed outline of each document with section headers and estimated content
2. Critical code paths identified for deep analysis

4. Questions about any ambiguous technical requirements

After approval:
- Generate documentation in order of technical dependency

- Include all discovered edge cases and gotchas

Priority Order

1. Highest Priority: ClassDB internals, Type system, Template specializations
2. High Priority: Memory model, Initialization, Error handling
3. Medium Priority: Code generation, Build system
4. Lower Priority: Complete example projects (after inline examples)

This documentation will serve as the definitive technical reference for godot-cpp internals, providing the deep technical
understanding required for advanced native extension development.

### Quality Assurance

#### Verification Requirements
- All documentation MUST be traced directly to source code
- No assumptions or generalizations can be made for ANY content included in the docs being generated
- Include source file references for critical information
- Mark any unclear areas for technical review

#### Completeness Checklist
- [ ] All programs from .sln file documented
- [ ] Cross-references between related programs included
- [ ] Index/search functionality configured in mdBook
- [ ] Navigation structure tested

### Execution Strategy

#### Initial Setup
- [ ] Create a master tracking spreadsheet/table with:
  - File/API/function/class/struct/macro name or identifier
  - Documentation status (Not Started/In Progress/Complete)
  - Primary function category
  - Dependencies
  - Verification status
  - Timestamp
  - Anything else beneficial to track in this context

#### Batching Approach
- Process code files/APIs/functions/macros/classes in logical groups
- Complete full documentation for each topic before moving to next
- Maintain context by documenting related code/functionality together

#### Progress Tracking
- Update master tracking file after each update is written to any markdown documentation
- Note any APIs/code/classes requiring special attention
- Flag complex internal functionality that may need deeper analysis to accurately capture

## Critical Notes
- **Accuracy is paramount**: This documentation will be used by C++ developers to understand the inner workings of godot-cpp and it's overall interaction with the Godot engine/editor.
  * **No assumptions/guessing/hallucinations**: Only document what can be verified in code to ensure this doesn't happen.
  * Any misinformation is much more harmful than lack of information
- **Maintain scope**: Use tracking tools to ensure no program is missed
- **Preserve context**: Work in large batches to maintain understanding of program relationships
